Write a final dessertation report for Financial Advisor Agent
I have provided you with two files 
1. Previous Mid sem report - which talks about the project and its objectives and the work done till mid sem
2. UI - python streamlit code for chat interface and user data input
3. Backend - Contains backend code for Agents, Teams and Agno code for running those agents using AgentOS

Consider both the fles and their content to write the report in the format specificed below

"""
A formal report usually contains the following elements:
(i) Introduction
(ii) Main Text
(iii) Conclusions and/or Recommendations
(iv) Appendices
(v) References
(vi) Glossary

The following is a brief description of each of these elements:
(vi) Introduction
In Introduction, the problem is defined and introduced. The Introduction
therefore contains the purpose of writing the report and sufficient background material,
including the literature surveyed to present the reader a clear picture of the project work. A
paraphrased outline of the work should also form a part of the Introduction. In the
Introduction of a report, the author discusses the scope and the limitations of his work. It is
also required to discuss the sources, methods and procedure employed in collecting and
organizing the data. The author is also expected to highlight the value of his work besides
indicating the need for writing the report.

A proper and effective Introduction should include a brief history of the
problem under discussion, coupled with the statement of the immediate problem under
examination, the reasons for undertaking it and a discussion of the methodology adopted.
Generally for WILP Dissertation project report, an Introduction may not be more than a couple
of pages.

(ii) Main Text
The actual work, the method of treatment and the results are presented in thispart
of a report. It may run into many sections and subsections under different headings and
subheadings. That should be numbered and phrased appropriately. Inorder to maintain
consistency, you are required to follow the same pattern as given inthe Table of Contents of
your report.

The main text contains the discussion on the experimental work doneor the
data collected, the survey done, a description of activities, analysis and the results obtained.
It also includes illustrations and interpretations. This is the main body of the report. All
illustrations (graphs, diagrams, tables, figures, etc.) should always be accompanied by a
number and an appropriate title. This helps the reader understandthe illustration in a better
way. It also helpsthe writerto referto these in the subsequentdiscussion.
Significant discrepancies in results should be called to the reader's attention, even

when it is admitted that no reasonable explanation can be offered. If the author himself
discovers these discrepancies and does not mention them, the technical credibility of the
report gets adversely affected.

(iii) Conclusions and/or Recommendations
The conclusions and recommendations are derived from the discussions and
interpretations of the results obtained. It would be helpful to the reader if other possibilities
pertaining to the stated conclusions and recommendations are alsodiscussed. The purpose of
the conclusions is to draw the attention of the reader to significant findings. Sometimes
conclusions contain a very brief summary of the maindiscussion. Recommendations suggest
ways and means of bringing about improvement.

(iv) Appendices
The contents of an appendix are essentially those which support or
elaborate the matter given in the main text. The matter, which is essential but will
unnecessarily divert the attention of the reader from the main problem, is generally placed in
the Appendix. We give below some items which normally form a part of the Appendix. These
are: (a) calculation sheets; (b) lengthy derivations of mathematical formulae; (if that is not the
project itself) (c) supplementary details of instructions; (d) flow charts; (e) computer
programmes; (f) questionnaires&interview sheets; (g) largemaps; (h) the nomenclature; etc.
If the project itself is about making of a computer programme of some problem,then
the flow chart and the computer programme have to be in the main body. It is forthe author
to decide, what matter would be placed in the Appendices according to nature of the project
work and problem definition.

(v) References
All the references to books, journals, documents, web site links etc. should
be given in the section called References. Two examples of how to write a reference are given
below:

Suppose you have referred to a paper entitled 'An Integral Equation
Satisfied by the Square of Weber's Parabolic Cylinder Function', whose author is S.C.Mitra,
which appeared in the Journal of London Mathematical Society whose volume number is 11,
the year of publication is 1936, and the article is published on pages 252 to 256; you would
write it as follows:

1. Mitra, S.C. , "An Integral Equation Satisfied by the Square of Weber's Parabolic
Cylinder Function" The Journal of London Mathematical Society, Volu. 11, 1936, pp.
252-256.
Again, in case you have referred to a book on An Introduction to Linear Algebra by Dr.
V. Krishnamurthy and others which was published by Affiliated East-West Press, NewDelhi in
the year 1976, the reference should be cited as given below:
2. Krishnamurthy, V. et al, "An Introduction to Linear Algebra," 1st edition, New

Delhi; Affiliated East-West Press, 1976, p.25.
The serial number of the reference should correspond to the number of citationin the
text of the report.

(vi) Glossary
Glossary is the list of technical words and terms used by the author in his report. It
normally includes the meaning of the word / term and the page no (s) whereit occurs in the
text of the report.
